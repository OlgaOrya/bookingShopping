All the evidence, the testimony of witnesses, points to one man - Terry Maitland. A youth baseball coach, an English teacher, a husband and father of two daughters - could he really do that? In addition, Terry has an irrefutable alibi: at the time of the crime, he was in another city. But how could the same person be in two places at the same time? Or has SOMETHING appeared in the city that can take on the appearance of any person?",

He thinks rom-coms are unrealistic--and he'll only put pen to paper if Evie shows him that it's possible to meet a man in real life the way it happens on the big screen.

Spilling orange juice on a cute stranger? No problem. Leaving her number in books all over London to see who calls? Done. With a little help from her well-meaning friends--and Ben and Anette, the adorable father-daughter duo who keep witnessing her humiliations--Evie is determined to prove she can meet a man the way Sally met Harry. But can a workaholic who's given up on love find a meet-cute of her very own?`,
